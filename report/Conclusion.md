# Summary
Our team set out to create an online store for a local pet shop called Fluff-galore. 
Its primary aim is to create a simple and basic online store in order to keep up with the shift in shopping habits in recent years.
This is also to better prepare the store's ability to cope with uncertainty amid corona virus.
Therefore our approach to the problem is to provide customers with an enjoyable and efficient shopping experience by designing a minimalistic and basic online store that is visually pleasing and easy to navigate.

To achieve the goals, we have agreed on and successfully implemented four basic and yet indispensable features : 1) User creation authentication system 2) Pet search/display 3)Pet management 4) Online orders
All of which was aimed to bring an efficient and safe way for pet owners from around the area to shop.

In the first week, we focused on setting a rough goal by confirming the features that we want to include, establishing communication tool and agreeing on the type of work style our team would adhere to. For the second week we stressed on realizing most features and towards the week we would finalize the website. Finally for the third week we shifted our focus on peer assessment of team members' part of the report.  Over the course of these three weeks, we conducted user research based on what we have so far to help us better understand the requirements of stakeholders .


# Analysis

Efficiency and pleasant shopping/viewing experience are the overarching aims of this project. To achieve these two goals, we have stayed with a very generic but minimalistic design for our website. 

The success in realizing the 'efficiency' aspect of our design is attributed to the minimalistic design and intuitive layout of our website, including a menu bar we have placed on the top of our website. Our menu has included two drop-down menus that provides two different ways of searching for pets/items in the online inventory - pet category and pet availability status. This is a simple and yet quick way to help customers to shrink down the scope of their pet search instead of having to just to scroll down the whole page. 

Giving customers the option to place orders online is yet again another basic and yet intuitive feature that contributes to the goal of 'efficiency'. This feature is indispensable in any sort of online store, as it is the very feature that allows customers to shop in their comfort zone. Additionally, considering that pet articles are likely to be unique, to make sure that there are no order clashes or confusion, we have also decided to add pet availability status to prevent customers from buying the same articles again. 

At first glace, our User creation authentication system is more of a step back from 'efficiency', this is because big online stores like ASOS or SHEIN all have the function of ordering items without user creation. However, in the context of small and private businesses,  survival and sustainability are priority and therefore we need to take into consideration of security implications of not having a user authentication system. Having a secure system will protect our pet store owners and help to eliminate any unwanted security issues that could end up costing both customers and pet store extra time to deal with. 

Lastly, the pleasant aspect of our aim is mainly achieved with a minimalism design. We put ourselves in the perspective of customers, we deliberately kept the website simple so as to reduce the website to the essentials when it comes to online browsing/shopping: pet images, names, Buttons that intuitively guide customers to the page they want to visit.

Overall, our final design has been very generic but it encompasses all principle functions that allows it to be an efficient and an aesthetically pleasing online store. 


# Reflection

Our members all responded actively over the course of past two and half weeks and as a result, the team was able to finish the project before the expected handover date. 

We stressed transparency in our communication and our success in completing the project prior to the scheduled date attributes largely to this efficient way of communication. We would officially have our meetings on Teams with a list of overall objectives and tasks delegated to each team members, and for any other communication on minor issues or decisions we would openly discuss them on our wechat group. Team members would also openly share any technical difficulties experienced and solutions in this chat group so that others were aware of these issues.  

Transparency has also helped to keep team members motivated throughout this period.  From looking at messages posted on our wechat group, team members were able to figure out who they should communicate with in order to complete their current task.  Sometimes team members had to resort to quick calls between certain members in order to clarify issues and they would announce their result in the wechat group. Being transparent with our communication holds everyone accountable for their actions and keeps everyone in check with their progress. It also helps other members by feeding them with the most up to day decisions of the project. 

We have adapted certain characteristics of Git Feature Branch Workflow  and tweaked it to suit the size and scope of our project. Given that our project has relatively small amount of programming, Feature in our case was more to do with different sections of our documentation instead of a function in a software. Each member is set out to create their own branch based on the dev branch and once work is done, we were to create pull requests for other members to review the changes made before agreeing to the merge request. This working style leads to peer assessment  of team members' work and once again, helps to avoid clashes and helps members to cooperate by increasing the overall work efficiency.
