# Abstract

With the advent of the internet, increasing number of people are shopping online, in order to keep up with the changing consuming habit and to potentially reach out to a greater number of potential customers, it is important that we create an online pet shop.

The nearest pet shop in Bristol is situated at least 2 miles away from the City center, and our pet shop is also situated on the outskirts of Bristol city center, with only 1 mile less than another pet shop situated on the South-west. It is easy for those who live near our shop, they can walk in and browse, for those who live far and who are new to getting a pet, they might decide to drive in and only to find that we do not have their ideal pet in store. For this reason, a pet store might help to make their pet-choosing experience more efficient.

Another reason for us to look slowly transforming our shop to an online one is also due to the uncertainty of the current pandemic. Even though the number of people tested positive for the virus is starting to decrease, but some might still refrain from visiting enclosed and public places unless necessary, this might be because they live with people that are more susceptible to the virus. Regardless of the reason behind their apprehension, but making our online shop available would provide these potential customers a safer way to browse and shop in their own comfort, and making it a good opportunity for us, the owner to tag along with the trend of fast and efficient internet shopping.
	
We would like to make an online pet shop that is easy to navigate, and visually pleasing to soon-to-be pet owners. The primary aim is to allow customers place their order, or at least to quickly get a good idea of the pets that we offer in our store, this is because the website is designed to automatically change the status of the item/pet online once someone has placed an order. We want to provide our customers not only the convenience to shop at home, but also to help them decide whether or not they want to make a trip down to our shop for an item that is actually available in store.

# Objectives

As the owners of the pet shop, we care about the survival and sustainability of our shop. This is why we see putting our shop online as a necessary transformation to take in order to be on par with the shopping habit in recent years. Therefore the primary goal with our online shop is to provide our customers with a safe and efficient way of choosing a pet, with or without a car or pandemic (or much time).
	
In order to make sure we can kickstart our online shop and eventually make it sustainable, we need to provide our customers a pleasant shopping experience. The 'best' online pet shops listed on www.makeusof.com, all share a common characteristic, which is that they all provide a clean looking home pages with minimalistic design and layout with a set of well considered labels to guide their customers through their website. 
	
With reference to these successful cases, our objectives for this website is to make sure that it provides a pleasant and efficient experience to browse or shop in our online store, we have broken down this "pleasant and efficient experience" down to smaller chunks to help our team to achieve it.

# description of all features

### Pet by categorization:
![petType](https://i.imgur.com/wNmHMHF.png)
One of our aims is to offer an efficient online shopping experience, although we do not have a lot of different types of pets available in our store, we have still decided to organize the display of our pets by category. This allows quicker search narrows down scope for both the customer who is looking for a specific pet and the shop owner, who might need to change up information of one particular pet.


### Pet find by status:
![categorization](https://i.imgur.com/ht99lOG.png)
Pet is also categorized by its status (available, pending, sold). This is another way to do pet search that helps with efficiency. Available are pets that are still in store. Pending would be those that have been added by a user to the cart but haven't done payment yet. And Sold is when the user has confirmed on their end that they have received the pet. 


### User creation and login:

Customers can only put pet in 'cart' once they have signed in, this feature has been strongly requested one of the owners of our shop and this feature is to keep a record to customers' address information so that in future purchases they will not be required to refill their home address and contact information. This owner understands that our store right now only specializes in pets, but he is looking to start buying in pet toys and other pet-related items for future sell. This feature may not prove much use right now, but as the business expand with a wider variety of goods, we hope to use this feature to help making the buying process an efficient one

### Add new pet:

This feature is an important one as the shop owners should be able to manage pet by adding/deleting pets available in the store. Or even manually change the status of the pet if needed to. The pop up window demands that that the user adds a pet name, pet category, and pet status(available, pending, sold) and tags too. This feature requires that the website understands the identity of the user. And only the administrator should be allowed to alter pet information on the online store inventory.

### Add pet photo:
![addphoto](https://i.imgur.com/kVJu0M8.png)

Ideally when we need to add/update the information of a pet, we should be allowed to add a photo of the pet as well so that the viewer will be able to have a good idea of what they are looking at.


### Flash cartoon before entering homepage:

Our website is to welcome users with a flash cartoon upon loading. This is a visual feature that hopes to entertain customers give them something visually pleasing before they start shopping. This would also be a harmless feature that is aimed to promote the Fluff-galore shop by associating  it with a light-hearted and cutesy imagery. 


### Quiz:
![Map](https://i.imgur.com/pErosaR.png=centerme)
This is a quiz that we hope to help people to find the perfect pet for them to buy, in terms of the most suitable type of pet based on pet personality of pets available with us in the store. The little quiz would consist a list of questions that asks you about your living space, and living habit and monthly budget etc. all questions that might be able to affect the type of pet one gets. We got the idea from the official website of PDSA, UK's leading veterinary charity : https://www.pdsa.org.uk/taking-care-of-your-pet/choosing-a-pet?_$ja=tsid:67827|cid:1785422340|agid:71441170509|tid:kwd-13580843929|crid:355603342260|nw:g|rnd:9471319939620912770|dvc:c|adp:|mt:e|loc:1006567&gclid=CjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGvVJWeNamNuwu2UHw88VuoxIla6-eKB28vqfLrgvZHMkEVNVrKJ-UxoC0Q4QAvD_BwE

### Cute cursor:

This feature falls under increasing pleasant experience side of our objective. It aims to change the normal cursor into a floaty and animated one. Again this works to promote the image of the petstore and hope that this will set us apart from all the other online pet shops.
