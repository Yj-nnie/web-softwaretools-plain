# Group Working
Before the start of any group project, it is important to decide which project management framework and concept to adopt, which determines the future development method of the project, organizational changes and other important aspects.

Agile and waterfall are the two mainstream project management methodology. Agile and waterfall often represent an irreversible fork in the road for any initiative. Generally speaking, in the same project, members must choose one of these concepts as the project management framework. 

### 1. Waterfall
Waterfall is a traditional project management method. Waterfall development usually spends a lot of time at the beginning to formulate very detailed plans and requirements, and then follow the plan step by step. In general, waterfall management is mainly a linear process. The steps include Requirements Determination, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance. All of the requirements for each step is completed before the next begins. All requirements for each step are completed before the next one starts.

#### Advantages of waterfall 
It works well for smaller size projects where requirements are easily understandable.
Precise project planning and fixed deadlines.
A predictable and well-specified final product.
Clear roles and responsibilities among members

#### Disadvantages of waterfall 
It is not an ideal model for a large size project.
Lack of flexibility after project planning.
If the market demand or technological environment changes, the project cannot meet the latest market demand.
There are fewer opportunities to correct the project.

### 2.Agile
Agile project management is iterative, which means that agile is completed in stages (sprints), and each sprint builds and improves the lessons of the previous sprint. At the beginning of the project, agile requires only a rough plan and idea for the project, and then as multiple sprints are continuously completed, members can continuously re-evaluate and correct the new requirements and results of the project, that is to say, Agile development is a process in which the requirements are expected to change and evolve. The larger project is broken down into smaller parts so that the project can progress in each sprint.

#### Advantages of agile
The project is flexible, and the content of the project can be continuously improved and revised as the project develops.
Strict rhythm, flexibility of deadlines.
Frequent updates and increased user value.

#### Disadvantages of agile
Susceptible to a lack of focus and knee-jerk reactions from sprint to sprint.
Loose planning can lead to unpredictable finished products and date delays.

### 3.The key difference between waterfall and agile
Agile allows the requirements of the project to be changed and further specified during the development of the project, but once the project starts, waterfall does not change the scope of the requirements

Agile method is more flexible, while waterfall is a structured project development method

Waterfall is a liner sequential life cycle model whereas continuous iteration is the core feature of agile.

### 4.Our choice
The working method of our group follows the agile management method. This is mainly based on the following reasons:

1. This project needs to add new functions to the petstore site. At the beginning of the project, we listed several new functions that can be added, but the specific implementation of several new functions and the final effect of the new functions are uncertain. Therefore, we need to continuously adjust our project goals based on the results of the work during the subsequent development of the project. Based on this, the agile concept is more suitable for our project management.

2. In addition, our project preparation time is only two weeks. The short preparation time requires us to decompose the complex project into multiple work parts to be completed by different members. Team members need to regularly check and improve each decomposed work product. Consequently, we decided to adopt agile concepts at the beginning of the project.


### 5. Team work tools
1. Daily meeting
   Microsoft teams is the main communication tool for our team members. Our team basically holds half-hour meetings every day. In the meetings, we mainly discuss three aspects.

   First, we will review the work that everyone has done in the past day, ask each other's problems and communicate and solve them. 

   Secondly, we will summarize the problems that occurred in our work in the past and avoid everyone from making the same mistakes in our future work. 

   Finally, we will set the goals that everyone needs to complete in the next stage and the desired content quality.

2. Daily Q&A chat
   The daily half-hour meeting sometimes cannot meet the frequent communication needs of members. Therefore, we use WeChat as a communication tool. We have established a group of five called "pet store". When a member has questions about the content of the meeting, he can post his thoughts through WeChat, and other members will help answer his doubts when they see the news. In addition, notices of meeting time changes and member requests for leave will also be released through this group.

# The agile project management framework used-scrum
There are multiple methods for managing agile projects. Our team uses the agile development framework of scrum.

# Team Roles

# Sprints
A project is composed of multiple sprints, and the entire project is equivalent to scrum. Every sprint has a goal to complete. Sprint is equivalent to an agile cycle. We have to complete in a sprint cycle, including, design, development, deployment, testing and other steps.

Specifically, a complete sprint meeting should include Sprint

1. Spring planning meeting requires members to plan what goals should be accomplished in this sprint. Assign different tasks according to the abilities of the members.
2. In the standup meeting, members share their work problems with each other, and other members need help to solve the problems.
3. A retro meeting requires members to review the entire sprint process. Reflect on the mistakes made in this sprint, and avoid similar mistakes made by members in the future.
