### 1. Difference from traditional project management
Traditional project management will make a detailed plan and detailed requirements at the beginning, and then try to follow the plan, but when agile starts to work, it has a rough idea of what is needed, and through delivering something in a short time, as the project progresses Develop and clarify the progress of the needs.
In short, the agile management method disassembles all the functions of the project development and develops them one by one, thereby improving efficiency and speeding up the progress of the project. These frequent iterative processes are the core characteristics of agile projects.
