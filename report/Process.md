# Group Working
Before the start of any group project, it is important to decide which project management framework and concept to adopt, which determines the future development method of the project, organizational changes and other important aspects.

Agile and waterfall are the two mainstream project management methodology. Agile and waterfall often represent an irreversible fork in the road for any initiative. Generally speaking, in the same project, members must choose one of these concepts as the project management framework. 

### 1. Waterfall
Waterfall is a traditional project management method. Waterfall development usually spends a lot of time at the beginning to formulate very detailed plans and requirements, and then follow the plan step by step. In general, waterfall management is mainly a linear process. The steps include Requirements Determination, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance. All of the requirements for each step is completed before the next begins. All requirements for each step are completed before the next one starts.

#### Advantages of waterfall 
It works well for smaller size projects where requirements are easily understandable.

Precise project planning and fixed deadlines.

A predictable and well-specified final product.

Clear roles and responsibilities among members

#### Disadvantages of waterfall 
It is not an ideal model for a large size project.

Lack of flexibility after project planning.

If the market demand or technological environment changes, the project cannot meet the latest market demand.

There are fewer opportunities to correct the project.

### 2. Agile
Agile project management is iterative, which means that agile is completed in stages (sprints), and each sprint builds and improves the lessons of the previous sprint. At the beginning of the project, agile requires only a rough plan and idea for the project, and then as multiple sprints are continuously completed, members can continuously re-evaluate and correct the new requirements and results of the project, that is to say, Agile development is a process in which the requirements are expected to change and evolve. The larger project is broken down into smaller parts so that the project can progress in each sprint.

#### Advantages of agile
The project is flexible, and the content of the project can be continuously improved and revised as the project develops.

Strict rhythm, flexibility of deadlines.

Frequent updates and increased user value.

#### Disadvantages of agile
Susceptible to a lack of focus and knee-jerk reactions from sprint to sprint.

Loose planning can lead to unpredictable finished products and date delays.

### 3. The key difference between waterfall and agile
Agile allows the requirements of the project to be changed and further specified during the development of the project, but once the project starts, waterfall does not change the scope of the requirements

Agile method is more flexible, while waterfall is a structured project development method

Waterfall is a liner sequential life cycle model whereas continuous iteration is the core feature of agile.

### 4. Our choice
The working method of our group follows the agile management method. This is mainly based on the following reasons:

1. This project needs to add new functions to the petstore site. At the beginning of the project, we listed several new functions that can be added, but the specific implementation of several new functions and the final effect of the new functions are uncertain. Therefore, we need to continuously adjust our project goals based on the results of the work during the subsequent development of the project. Based on this, the agile concept is more suitable for our project management.

2. In addition, our project preparation time is only two weeks. The short preparation time requires us to decompose the complex project into multiple work parts to be completed by different members. Team members need to regularly check and improve each decomposed work product. Consequently, we decided to adopt agile concepts at the beginning of the project.


### 5. Team work tools
1. Daily meeting
   Microsoft teams is the main communication tool for our team members. Our team basically holds half-hour meetings every day. In the meetings, we mainly discuss three aspects.

   First, we will review the work that everyone has done in the past day, ask each other's problems and communicate and solve them. 

   Secondly, we will summarize the problems that occurred in our work in the past and avoid everyone from making the same mistakes in our future work. 

   Finally, we will set the goals that everyone needs to complete in the next stage and the desired content quality.

2. Daily Q&A chat
   The daily half-hour meeting sometimes cannot meet the frequent communication needs of members. Therefore, we use WeChat as a communication tool. We have established a group of five called "pet store". When a member has questions about the content of the meeting, he can post his thoughts through WeChat, and other members will help answer his doubts when they see the news. In addition, notices of meeting time changes and member requests for leave will also be released through this group.

# The agile project management framework used-Scrum
Agile development is a development method and concept. There are many models for agile development, such as Scrum model, XP extreme programming and so on. The Scrum model is the most used development model in agile development, accounting for more than 66%. Our team uses the agile development framework of scrum.

 ### Scrum & Sprint
When using scrum to implement agile development, the entire project is divided into several small work parts, and each small part is called a “sprint”. This entire project is equivalent to scrum. A sprint usually takes one to three weeks. All the team members need to do is to repeat the sprint until the product features are fully developed, and finally get the project version that can be released. This work framework enables the team to accurately deliver products that meet the latest market needs of customers.

Every sprint has a goal to complete. Sprint is equivalent to an agile cycle. We have to complete in a sprint cycle, including, design, build , test, review and other steps.

Under the Scrum framework, the development of the project is mainly divided into the following five stages:

1.	Collect the user story, which is a way of describing a feature set. Then the product owner determines some of the features that the product needs to develop based on the user stories, and proposes the highlights of the product to form a product demand list -product backlog.
2.	In the sprint planning meeting, all members of the team discuss the top priority user story and assign different tasks according to the abilities of the members. At the same time, this meeting should also determine the user need that need to be developed for the next sprint.
3.	Make a sprint backlog according to the sprint planning of the previous stage, which a list of user stories that have been commits to the next sprint. The user story of the sprint backlog is what needs to be considered in the next phase of the sprint.
4.	Team members develop and complete the user requirements in the sprint list in a short time. During each sprint, team members conduct daily scrum basically every day. In the meeting, team members brief each other on their work progress and raise their own problems.
5.	After the completion of each sprint, team members need to hold a sprint review. During the meeting, members review the entire sprint process, show the functions that have been developed, discuss and reflect on the mistakes that occurred in this sprint, and avoid similar mistakes in the future.
