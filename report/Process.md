# Group Working
The working method of our group follows the agile management method. Agile is a software development method and project management method based on delivering software in small parts of work and introducing changes when needed. Needs and results can be evaluated and corrected during the development process.

### 1. Difference from traditional project management
Traditional project management will make a detailed plan and detailed requirements at the beginning, and then try to follow the plan, but when agile starts to work, it has a rough idea of what is needed, and through delivering something in a short time, as the project progresses Develop and clarify the progress of the needs.

In short, the agile management method disassembles all the functions of the project development and develops them one by one, thereby improving efficiency and speeding up the progress of the project. These frequent iterative processes are the core characteristics of agile projects.

### 2. The agile project management framework used-scrum
There are multiple methods for managing agile projects. Our team uses the agile development framework of scrum.

### 3. Team work tools
1. Daily meeting
   Microsoft teams is the main communication tool for our team members. Our team basically holds half-hour meetings every day. In the meetings, we mainly discuss three aspects.

   First, we will review the work that everyone has done in the past day, ask each other's problems and communicate and solve them. 

   Secondly, we will summarize the problems that occurred in our work in the past and avoid everyone from making the same mistakes in our future work. 

   Finally, we will set the goals that everyone needs to complete in the next stage and the desired content quality.

2. Daily Q&A chat
   The daily half-hour meeting sometimes cannot meet the frequent communication needs of members. Therefore, we use WeChat as a communication tool. We have established a group of five called "pet store". When a member has questions about the content of the meeting, he can post his thoughts through WeChat, and other members will help answer his doubts when they see the news. In addition, notices of meeting time changes and member requests for leave will also be released through this group.

# Team Roles

# Sprints
A project is composed of multiple sprints, and the entire project is equivalent to scrum. Every sprint has a goal to complete. Sprint is equivalent to an agile cycle. We have to complete in a sprint cycle, including, design, development, deployment, testing and other steps.



# Continuous Integration
