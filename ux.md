
## Implemention - Front End/UX:

### Development

#### Prototyping (27/07/21-31/07/21)

For the project, our initial idea involved creating a login page, which is convienient for user to manage their own accounts. After the first discussion, we should achieve:

* Creating the initial prototype in order to give a direction for development
* Making the features of site
* Figure out what the customer needs

Figure 1: The initial wireframe
</div>


The creation of this wireframe also allowed us to clarify what feature we should achieve, namely:

* The login page for user (manage their own account)
* The categories of pets (make the site more clear)
* The function of shooping cart (make user see what they choose at the moment)
