
# Implemention - Front End/UX:

In this part, I would like to write based on my design timeline and show how to go through interations by user feedback. Although it is not in the order of the template, it contains all thing the template requires.

## System flow and Timeline

## Prototyping 

For the project, our initial idea involved creating a login page, which is convienient for user to manage their own accounts. After the first discussion, we should achieve:

* Creating the initial prototype in order to give a direction for development
* Making the features of site
* Figure out what the customer needs

The creation of this wireframe also allowed us to clarify what feature we should achieve further, namely:

* The login page for user (manage their own account)
* The categories of pets (make the site more clear)
* The function of shooping cart (make user see what they choose at the moment)


## Development

Based on the above deign choices, we decide to make the first survey for users. The final design scheme is decided according to the user feedback, including the layout of the site, site features and site improvements.

### Survey 1: The proposal of the website

#### Research objectives

During the prototyping stages, we conduct the first survey to confirm the proposal of our site. Our research objectives were as follow:

* The effectiveness of the features of website
* Focus of site UI design
* Evaluating what users focus on

Firstly, we give participants a summary of our project brief and asked to go over. Then, we have sent out 20 questionnaires and finally received 16 respnses. To make sure the survey is universal, we surveyed people of different ages. We also took into account gender and the experience of keeping a pet.

The survey form is [here](https://github.com/Yj-nnie/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/dlh8899/survey/survey1.pdf). And the feedback form click [here](https://github.com/Yj-nnie/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/dlh8899/survey/feedback1.xlsx).

#### Findings

Throughout the survey, we can test our website whether the features is suitable for users. And we can gather some suggestions for our website from users to improve it during the stage of development.

<br>

**_These questions below prove that user indeed need the features we proposed before._**

</div>

**Question 4**: Most people prefer to have their own account, therefore, a login page contributes to improve user experience. 


<div align=center>

</div>

**Question 5**: The answer suggests that many users already make a decision on which pet to buy before they log on to the online store. Hence the categories of pets is necessary for users, which allow them to look through the kind of pet they need.

<br>

**_These questions below give us a reference for the style and content design of the website._**

<div align=center>

</div>

**Question 2**: For users, the layout of the site is the most attractive. We then asked about the style of the site, which helped us achieve the final design choice.

**Question 5**: Through the user feedback, the cartoon style is the most popular choice. A part of users choose the minimalism style. This may give us inspiration of combination of these two styles.


<div align=center>
<img src=survey/fb6.jpeg width="600px" height="200px">
</div>

**Question 6**: All users hope that they can view more details about their pet choices. We should add each pet's information, such as age, photo, and character.

### The prototype implemention

After the first survey, we focus on developing it along with above user feedback, which further aided us in implemting a user centric methodology. We do the paper prototype in more detail to show all features of the site, including logging in, placing the order and classifying by pets species, and the front end develop the layout of the whole website. We decide to represent this paper prototype to users and gather their feedback to develop the website.

#### Objectives

* Determine the style of the site among possible design choices
* Make the layout of the site clear
* The paper prototype should be coherent

#### Design choices

### Survey 2: The feedback of the paper prototype

We use zoom to gather user experience feedback. Participants were sent the paper prototype before the group zoom call. During the zoom call, the researcher walked everyone through the prototype. After the zoom call, participants were sent two questions and asked to respond. In the end, we received seven responses.

**Research Question 1**: Do you have any suggestions on the layout of the site?

We filter the responses and extract the following responses which are mentioned many times.

>>**User 1** _"A little confusion for the tag of add pet, maybe I don't need this function"_<br>
>>**User 2** _"Homepage can be more colorful"_<br>
>>......<br>
>>**User 5**  _"I don't think the categories of pets should be on the tag"_<br>
>>**User 7**  _"I wonder why I need add the pet, it's for selling my own pet?"_<br>

**Research Question 2**: Do you need other features in our website?

>>**User 2** _"The after-sales service"_<br>
>>**User 4** _"Don't see further details about the pet"_<br>
>>......<br>
>>**User 7** _"I'd like to see more photos of pets, even gifs"_<br>

#### Findings

According to the user responses, we should accomplish the following tasks which belongs to the front end:

* Optimize the home page
* Modify the tag, clarifying the categories of pets
* Distinguish between user and adminstrator accounts
* Insert more pet photos and gifs
